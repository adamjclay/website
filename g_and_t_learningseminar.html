<u>Title:</u> An introduction to persistent homology with applications to shape analysis <br>
<u>Abstract:</u>  Persistent homology was developed starting in the 1990s to study the duration of topological properties along a filtration of spaces. It proved very useful in applications to shape recognition and analysis, by allowing one to recognize noise from geometrically relevant data. In this talk, I will describe the theory of persistent homology and some of its extensions such as multidimensional persistence, and show some interesting applications of the theory to applied problems.  <br>

<u>Title:</u> Free subgroups of groups of homeomorphisms <br>
<u>Abstract:</u>  The goal of this talk is to contrast two fundamental results concerning the dynamics of group actions on the unit interval, namely the abundance of free subgroups in Homeo_+([0,1]) and the absence of nonabelian free subgroups in PL_+([0,1]).  The proofs of both abundance and absence of free subgroups are quite short, so if time permits I will provide an outline of both.  <br>

<u>Abstract:</u>   The ping-pong lemma is a fundamental tool in the study of group actions. It allows one to identify certain groups as free products and to embed free products into other more interesting groups.  I will discuss the lemma in both its basic and more general forms, and will provide plenty of examples and applications. <br>

<u>Abstract:</u>   Teichmuller space is a moduli space of equivalence classes of Riemann surfaces.  In the first half of the talk I will give an overview of the problem of complex analytic equivalence of Riemann surfaces, and its relation to the Teichmuller space in the special case of compact surfaces.

<u>Title:</u>  On bi-orderability of knots. <br>
<u>Abstract:</u>   It is well known that every knot is left-orderable (i.e. the fundamental group of the complement of the knot in S^3 is left-orderable). On the other hand, not every knot is bi-orderable, e.g. non-trivial torus knots are never bi-orderable. A beautiful result by B.Perron and D.Rolfsen (2003) claims that if a knot is fibered and all roots of the Alexander polynomial are real and positive then the knot is bi-orderable. This result applies, for example, to the Figure-8 knot showing its bi-orderability; the Alexander polynomial of it equals t^2-3t+1. In recent years, A.Clay and D.Rolfsen have obtained new results which allows to decide the bi-orderability for most of the knots with a small crossing number. 

We develop tools which is effective in treating a broad class of knots. We are able to show that the knots 6_2 and 7_6 are not bi-orderable. These are the only two knots up to crossing number 7 whose bi-orderability was not known.  This is a joint work with Cody Martin. <br>

<u>Title:</u>  An algorithm for determining non bi-orderability of knots. <br>
<u>Abstract:</u>   Determining when two knots are equivalent (one can be transformed to the other via an ambient isotopy) is central to knot theory. One method for determining equivalence is by studying knot invariants: properties of a knot invariant under ambient isotopy. The Alexander polynomial is an example of a knot invariant. Another knot invariant is bi-orderability: A knot K is called bi-orderable if its knot group is bi-orderable, meaning it can be given an ordering that is invariant  under multiplication by the left and the right. The knot is called non bi-orderable otherwise. <br>

The bi-orderability of many knots remain unknown. I will discuss results that determine bi-orderability for certain knots. These results rely heavily on studying the roots of the Alexander polynomial. <br>

Next, I will demonstrate an algorithm for determining if a group is non bi-orderable. I will discuss an implementation of this algorithm using properties specific to knot groups for improvements on running-time. Using this computer program, it was shown that if K is an alternating knot with fewer than ten crossings whose Alexander polynomial has no real positive roots, then K is non bi-orderable.  <br>

<u>Title:</u>  Introduction to the space of left-orderings II<br>
<u>Abstract:</u>  From any left-orderable group G one can create a compact topological space called “the space of left-orderings,” denoted by LO(G).  Algebraic properties of the underlying group are reflected in the topology of this space, however even groups which are well-understood can produce spaces of left-orderings that are poorly understood.  In this talk, I will explain the construction LO(G), investigate its structure in some simple cases and explain how it has served as a great tool in proving some open conjectures.  <br>

<u>Abstract:</u>  This talk is a brief introduction to vector bundles. After reviewing some basic definitions/examples, we’ll introduce some natural vector bundles over Grassmannian manifolds and discuss how these vector bundles are "universal", meaning that (almost) all vector bundles can be obtain from members of this family.  <br>

<u>Title:</u> Hyperbolic Geometry in Complex Analysis <br>
<u>Abstract:</u>  Hyperbolic geometry developed together with complex analysis, through work of Fuchs, Poincare, Schwarz and others.  In spite of this, the simple and elegant  connections between the two fields are not very well known except to specialists. We give an overview of hyperbolic geometry in the unit disk. We then give examples of theorems in complex analysis in which hyperbolic geometry (or more generally, negatively curved metrics) plays a central role.  <br>

<u>Speaker:</u> Adam Clay <br>
<u>Date:</u> Sept 17, 2015 <br>
<u>Title:</u> Introduction to group growth <br>
<u>Abstract:</u>  Given a set of generators for a group, it’s natural to ask how many elements of the group can be written as a product of k or fewer generators, for some positive integer k.  As k varies, so will the answer to this question, and this observation leads naturally to the idea of a "growth function" of a group: it is a function that describes the size of the set of group elements that can be written as a product of length k or less.<br>
	In this talk, I will give a rigorous definition of the growth function of a group, and compute the growth functions of some of the groups that we encounter in daily life.  I will also discuss equivalence of growth functions, so that our results don’t depend on a choice of generating set.<br>

<u>Date:</u> Nov 27, 2014 <br>
<u>Title:</u> Fuchsian groups and the uniformization theorem <br>
<u>Abstract:</u>   The uniformization theorem is a deep generalization of the
Riemann mapping theorem.  It says that the universal cover of any 
Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to the disk, plane, or
sphere.  Aside from a handful of exceptions, the covering is 
the disk.  <br>

Fuchsian groups are the groups of complex analytic deck 
transformations of this covering.  They also happen to be 
groups preserving hyperbolic distance, and thus can be seen
to give tilings of the disk with respect to this non-Euclidean 
geometry.<br>

In this talk I will give a friendly non-technical introduction 
to these concepts. <br>

<u>Title:</u> Dimension and the fundamental group of a manifold <br>
<u>Abstract:</u>   In this talk I will discuss some properties of the fundamental group that are influenced by the dimension of the underlying manifold.  For example, we know exactly what groups will arise as the fundamental group of a 1 or 2 dimensional manifold, because the manifolds in these dimensions are completely classified.  On the other hand, if we’re given a k-manifold where k>2, what special properties of its fundamental group can we expect for particular values of k?  This talk is based on notes of Stefan Friedl. <br>

<u>Title:</u> Alexander invariants of knot groups <br>
<u>Abstract:</u>   In this talk we will introduce Alexander invariants of knots by way of their knot group.  By using a Wirtinger presentation of a knot group we can 
draw many conclusions about their Alexander invariants, including the vanishing of the zeroth elementary ideal, principality of the first elementary ideal, and normalization of the Alexander polynomial.  Time-permitting we will discuss the twisted versions of the above constructions.  <br>

<u>Title:</u> Geometry using Group Theory <br>
<u>Abstract:</u>   While visualization is the source of all geometry, group theory is a part of abstract algebra.  However, these two topics interact beautifully as expounded by Felix Klein in his famous Erlanger Program recalled by Eric in his talk last week. We plan to use the familiar calculus of reflections as a backdrop to demonstrate the expressive power of group theory to systematically build geometric concepts by just using the algebra of groups. This will show that group theory and plane geometry are but two sides of the same concept. The axioms we use were introduced by Frederich Backhmann to describe the Hjelmslev planes.

<u>Abstract:</u>  Using the Poincar&eacute;  conjecture as motivation, I’ll introduce a construction of Max Dehn, now known as Dehn surgery, as a way of constructing counterexamples to Poincar&eacute; ’s first conjecture (but not his second conjecture, which is the famous one).  Dehn’s construction was later (~1960's) shown to be an extremely versatile way of constructing 3-manifolds, and so has become a fundamental tool in the study of low-dimensional topology.<br>

<u>Abstract:</u> This talk will provide an introduction to the braid groups from several different perspectives.  I will show how they can be defined by generators and relations, as isotopy classes of arcs or surface homeomorphisms, or as fundamental groups.  Each perspective allows for different geometric or algebraic intuition, which often allows for straightforward insight into complex proofs.  For each approach introduced I will highlight some of the results that intuitively (though perhaps not easily) follow from the definitions.<br>
